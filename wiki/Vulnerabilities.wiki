This is a list of Kaillera vulnerabilities, found by myself unless otherwise noted.

= Ownaclient Vulnerabilites =


1.  Function re_append in Ownaclient introduces a buffer overflow vulnerability not found in Open Kaillera relating to handling large amounts of message spam.

2.  Ownaclient inherits #1 in Open Kaillera.

3.  Two off-by-one overflows in Ownaclient v17 relating to username and quit message (not serious because they are local).  Patched in v18.

4.  Crash involved locally in sending long private message.  Patched in v18.

= Open Kaillera Vulnerabilities =


1.  The following functions used insecure string copying resulting in buffer overflows:

kaillera_gdebug

kaillera_core_debug

kaillera_ui_motd

kaillera_error_callback

These functions can all be found in kaillera_ui.cpp.
